# Pseudo-Code and Flowcharts

## Pseudo-Code

Pseudo-code is meant for humans to read. It's helpful to spend time writing pseudo-code before going to programming code, since it helps to load the problem into your brain and make sure you understand it well.
Writing a solution in pseudo-code first helps to separate the logical problem domain layer from the syntactical programming language layer.

### Formal Pseudo-Code

Some common pseudo-code keywords that help break the logic into concrete commands, making the translation to program code easier:
START: start of the program
SET: sets a variable
GET: retrieves input from user
PRINT: displays output to user
READ: retrieves value from variable
IF/ELSE IF/ELSE: shows conditional branches in logic
WHILE: shows looping logic
SUBPROCESS: notes that another method/function/process will handle something. Helps make pseudo-code for a larger program clearer.
END: end of the program

### Going from Pseudo-Code to Code

The first pass at the code is to ensure that the logic works. Once you verify that it does, you can start to improve the code at the language level.
In larger, more sophisticated problems, you need to take a piecemeal approach to this, tackling one part of the program at a time.

## Flowcharts

Flowcharts help map out the logical sequence of a program visually.
Use these shapes:
Oval: Start/Stop
Rectangle: Processing Step
Parallelogram: Input/Output
Diamond: Decision
Circle: Connector
They can help with mapping out the step-by-step logic (the _procedural_ way of solving a problem).
In higher-level languages like Ruby, basic concepts are encapsulated in methods; using those is the _declarative_ way of solving a problem. Flowcharts looking at a high level view of a large program can use declarative syntax.
Then the subprocesses can be mapped out in more detail in a separate flowchart.
